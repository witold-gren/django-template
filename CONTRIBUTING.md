How to Contribute
=================

Always happy to get issues identified and pull requests!

Getting your pull request merged in
------------------------------------

1. Keep it small. The smaller the pull request the more likely I'll pull it in.
2. Pull requests that fix a current issue get priority for review.
3. If you're not already in the `CONTRIBUTORS.md` file, add yourself!
